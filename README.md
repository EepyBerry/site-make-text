A simple word maker in the style of [Baba Is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/)! <br>
Includes options to make `NOUN`s, `PROPERTY`s, cross them out, colour them and more!

## Run locally

Clone the repository then use the following commands:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the application locally: `npm run dev` / `npm run dev-host`

The app runs on port 5173 by default; `dev-host` exposes the application to the local network.

## Build project

Building is done with the following command:

- `npm run build`

Vite copies the output to the `dist` folder, creating it first if need be.
